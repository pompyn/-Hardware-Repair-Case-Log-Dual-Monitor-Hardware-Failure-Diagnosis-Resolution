## Dual-Monitor Hardware Failure Diagnosis & Resolution

### Scenario  
After stepping away from the desk, both monitors displayed **“inactive / no signal.”**  
Power was verified, but no video communication occurred between the computer and either monitor.

---

### Actions Taken  
1. Verified monitor power and cable integrity.  
2. Swapped video cables and tested alternate GPU ports.  
3. Determined the primary GPU output functioned correctly; secondary GPU caused total signal loss when connected.  
4. Removed the faulty GPU and confirmed single-monitor stability.  
5. Implemented a temporary single-monitor setup and ordered a **DisplayLink USB-to-HDMI adapter** as a workaround.

---

### Skills & Tools Demonstrated  
- Component isolation and substitution testing  
- Cable and port diagnostics  
- GPU and PCIe troubleshooting  
- Understanding of display interfaces (DisplayPort, HDMI, USB)  
- Logical fault isolation and implementation of alternative video output  
- **Certifications Applied:** CompTIA A+ | Network+ | Security+  

---

### Outcome  
System functionality restored using the working GPU output.  
A DisplayLink adapter will restore dual-monitor capability without hardware replacement.

---

### (Optional Future Update)
Once the DisplayLink adapter arrives, confirm that the dual-monitor configuration is fully operational and note any performance improvements or driver considerations.
